function [x,w] = GaussLegPtsPds(n);
% GLNodeWt  Nodes and weights for Gauss-Legendre quadrature of arbitrary order
%           obtained by solving an eigenvalue problem
%
% Synopsis:  [x,w] = GaussLegPtsPds(n)
%
% Input:     n = order of quadrature rule
%
% Output:    x = vector of quadrature points
%            w = vector of quadrature weights

beta   = (1:n-1)./sqrt(4*(1:n-1).^2 - 1);
J      = diag(beta,-1) + diag(beta,1);    % eig(J) needs J in full storage
[V,D]  = eig(J);
[x,ix] = sort(diag(D));  %  nodes are eigenvalues, which are on diagonal of D
w      = V(1,ix)'.^2;  %  V(1,ix)' is column vector of first row of sorted V
